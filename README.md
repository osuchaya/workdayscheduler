## Description

This application is part of module 5 on Third Party APIs where the objective is to create a simple calendar application that allows user to save event for each hour of the work day. The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The current time is displayed on the header of the page and as the current hour in the calendar is shown in green. The future hours are shown in red and past hours are shown in grey. The calendar is live in terms of time and date.

## Learning points
The author learned to implement what is learnt during Third-Party APIs module in order to import Content Delivery Network (CDN) to leverage third-party API and JavaScript library that provide displays live information such as date and time via Dayjs to the browser application. The author is introduced to jQuery as alternative to perform DOM manipulation and to make HTML element dynamic. The application contained some bootstrap elements which was introduced during this module. Although the author did not directly apply bootstrap as starter code was given but had to modify relevant elements.

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application. This includes documents from https://day.js.org and https://getbootstrap.com (relevant version) and tutor who helped to explain how to manipulate DOM and use of appropriate functions to execute and enhance my understanding of the module from which this project is based upon.
